Press Release on Completion of first Dry Run of Data Science Capstone course
November 1, 2014

Introduction
------------
The past few years has seen the explosion of the MOOC phenomenon. These Massive Open Online Courses bring closer the day when worldclass education is available to anyone on the planet for free. The [Coursera platform](https://www.coursera.org/about/) was set up with precisely this aim.

Data Science Specialization
---------------------------

The [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/about/) is the largest school of public health in the world, receives 20 percent of all grants and contracts awarded to the 50 accredited U.S. schools of public health, and has been ranked No. 1 by U.S. News & World Report since 1994.

In July 2014, as part of their continuing education mission, they launched nine new Data Science courses (MOOCs) in collaboration with Coursera. More than 800,000 people have now registered for these. These courses covered all the steps required for participants to develop expertise in Data Science, and are grouped as the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage). The top 65 students with outstanding results in all 9 courses were invited to participate in the dry run for the Capstone Project.

The Captone Project
-------------------

The Capstone is the cherry on the top of this specialization. It presented a difficult real-world challenge that stretched participants to their limits. This involved using a messy textual dataset of web-based material to develop a predictive language model, such as that used on a mobile device. The challenge was developed in conjunction with [Swiftkey](http://swiftkey.com/en/), a well known commercial leader in the field, whose mobile keyboard product uses Natural Language Processing predictive analytics.

Natural language processing is a notoriously difficult problem. The flexibility of language structure, spelling variations and abbreviations, use of multiple languages et.c. all added to the difficulties. The project aim was to produce a working language model so that this could be integrated into a web application.

30 trail-blazers have now completed the dry run for the Capstone Project. All rose to the challenge magnificently, and we are duly proud of their achievements.

Quotes from Participants
------------------------
Gianfranco says: "Personally, I approached this process of specialization with the enthusiasm given by the combination of an exciting topic of training with the prestigious award that the JHU offers. The challenge has been demanding as expected, I really enjoyed the selection of a topic never addressed in the courses taken, and at the same time highly successful and which are expected to further growth in the near future. I can not think of a better choice. I have to thank all my classmates for their excellent cooperation and sharing that has dramatically enhanced the overall learning experience."
Jay says: "It is hard to describe in few words how powerfully the overall Data Science Specialization program has impacted my life - both professionally and personally. I am using many of the skills honed right now in my work projects. I also been given the opportunity to provide a keynote address to NATO on data science - something I would not have been equipped for without this program. It has been a superb thrill and I must acknowledge all the great people I've had the chance to interact with this year (and for years to come)."
