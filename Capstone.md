### Research Materials for Capstone Data Science Course

Here is an excellent chapter from [Jurafsky and Martin (2000, 1ed) on n-Grams.] (http://www.slideshare.net/gendrong/1ed-jurafsky-martin-chap6ngram) It provides a comprehensive dicussion of not only assembling n-grams but also discussions on:

* Smoothing
* Discounting
* Backoff
* Deleted Interpolation
* Entory (Perplexity)

I would also like to recommend this [NLP Lunch Tutorial: Smoothing] (http://nlp.stanford.edu/~wcmac/papers/20050421-smoothing-tutorial.pdf) by Bill MacCarthney at Stanford that does a good job of summarizing the key points from the Jurafsky and Martin work. Either of these sources are likely to provide us with the knowledge to develop the alogorithms we will need for this Capstone project.

I have included the code used to generate the predictive model based on the R Markdown report
